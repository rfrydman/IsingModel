    "In the lectures, we've been discussing the physics, some of the history, and the computational methods that underlie the analysis of the deceptively simple *Ising model*. In this assignment, you will bring much of that to bear by evaluating the evolution towards equilibrium of the Ising model system in 2 dimensions, and analyze the properties of the system once it reaches equilibrium. Given the extensive nature of this assigment, and the fact that it relies on much of what we have discussed so far, you have 2 weeks to complete it. That is, the assigments are due on *November 1st at 2pm* (via `GitHub` as usual).\n",

    "In seeking to explain a particular phenomenon in physics, namely the onset of ferromagnetism, Wilhelm Lenz proposed in 1924 that his PhD student, Ernst Ising, should solve a puzzling 1-dimensional model of  [[arXiv:1706.01764](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01764)]. This model was meant to attempt to describe the interaction of \n",

    "a problem which belonged to the new and undeveloped quantum mechanics. In order to make any progress at all, Ising started in 1 dimension with the task of calculating analytically the macroscopic magnetization with the methods of statistical mechanics.

    "\n",
    "In the famous paper *\"Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines\"*, Nicholas Metropolis, Arianna W. Rosenbluth, Marshall N. Rosenbluth, Augusta H. Teller, and Edward Teller proposed to use a Boltzmann factor for attempting the *trials* for a given change in configuration of the lattice.\n",

    "1. Detailed balance\n",
    "\n",
    "For *ergodicity*, the method must allow that for a sufficiently long period of time, *all accessible microstates will be sampled*. A corollary is that the time spent by a system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region. \n",

    "  \n",
    "The condition of ergodicity tells us that we are allowed to make some of the transition probabilities of our Markov process zero, but that there must be at least one path of non-zero transition probabilities between any two states that we pick. \n",
    "  \n",
    "In practice, most Monte Carlo algorithms set almost all of the transition probabilities to zero, and we *must be careful that in so doing we do not create an algorithm which violates ergodicity*.\n",
