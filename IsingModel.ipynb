    "# Assignment 3: Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures, we've been discussing the physics, some of the history, and the computational methods that underlie the analysis of the deceptively simple *Ising model*. In this assignment, you will bring much of that to bear by evaluating the evolution towards equilibrium of the Ising model system in 2 dimensions, and analyze the properties of the system once it reaches equilibrium. Given the extensive nature of this assigment, and the fact that it relies on much of what we have discussed so far, you have 2 weeks to complete it. That is, the assigments are due on *November 1st at 2pm* (via `GitHub` as usual).\n",

    "In seeking to explain a particular phenomenon in physics, namely the onset of ferromagnetism, Wilhelm Lenz proposed in 1924 that his PhD student, Ernst Ising, should solve a puzzling 1-dimensional model of  [[arXiv:1706.01764](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01764)]. This model was meant to attempt to describe the interaction of \n",
